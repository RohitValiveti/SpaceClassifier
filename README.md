## Description
While spending the summer of 2020 researching the uses of deep learning in data processing and image classification under Professor Nada Amin, I undertook an independent project that combines my passion for programming with my childhood wonder of astronomy. Throughout the summer, I trained a neural network model using the PyTorch and fast.ai frameworks of Python that classifies various types of objects in space. Upon completing the model, I used simple HTML, CSS, and scripting to deploy and create a web app. Linked above is a demonstration of the classifier. Working on this project introduced me to many complicated concepts relating to AI and deep learning, but my final project is a testament to how I faced these challenges with some help from Professor Amin.
